HW 4

The object i created for this homework is a ramen bowl with 2 chopsticks. The bowl itsself is a sphere with the top half verticies deleted and the chopsticks are 2 rectangles tappered and attached t the bowl. I painted these with one color in the texturepaint tab. Origional i tried to overlay a JPG but that wasnt showing up in opengl. 

The spline was created by looking at 2 points forward and one point back
